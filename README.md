# Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST + CNN)

This is a browser-based handwritten digit recognition project.  
You can draw digits (0‚Äì9) on an HTML canvas, and a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the **MNIST dataset** will predict the digit instantly using **TensorFlow.js**.

## üöÄ Features

- Draw digits directly in your browser.
- Real-time predictions with no server required.
- Pretrained CNN model (28√ó28 grayscale input).
- Simple and responsive user interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** for the frontend.
- **TensorFlow.js** for running the model in the browser.
- **MNIST Dataset** for training.
- **Python + TensorFlow/Keras** (optional) for model training.
